# Description
This dataset is based on information collected from an online food delivery platform. It includes various attributes related to occupation, family size, feedback. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer demographics, their feedback, and order patterns and offers an at-a-glance understanding of the consumer base and their engagement with our service based on a range of key factors, including monthly income, occupation, age, and more.

# Insights
1. The age distribution suggests a younger customer base, pinpointing opportunities for marketing campaigns tailored to this audience.
2. A number of orders come from the 'No Income' category, possibly reflecting student participation or preferences for anonymity in income reporting.
3. The feedback is predominantly positive in the highlighted regions. This could imply customer satisfaction with the service in these areas.
4. Analysis by occupation shows that employees and students are frequent patrons, which may inform specialized promotional activities or collaborative ventures.
5. The income category '25001 to 50000' has the second highest negative feedback proportion, at 30.43%, while the 'More than 50000' group sees a drop in negative feedback to 19.35%. This suggests that customer satisfaction may increase with higher income levels.
6. The income group 'Below Rs.10000' shows the highest proportion of negative feedback, at 44%. This could indicate a higher level of dissatisfaction with your product or service among the lowest income bracket.
